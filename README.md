This project helped me to undertand how to implement redux toolkit

> It uses __createApi__ - from "RTK Query" to provide redux services for the application
> Along with- __fetchBaseQuery__ - a small wrapper around fetch that aims to simplify request.
> Create redux store with __configureStore__ API from Redux Toolkit.
> The __reducerPath__ in the crypto API services is a unique key that our service will be mounted onto in the store.
> The Redux reducer core functionality is enabled in the store and attached to the imported cryptoApi services
